                   Our country, India is the largest democratic
country in the world. So it is essential to make sure that the
governing body is elected through a fair election. India has
only offline voting system which is not effective and upto the
mark as it requires large man force and it also requires more
time to process and publish the results. Therefore, to be made
effective, the system needs a change, which overcomes these
disadvantages. The new method does not force the person's
physical appearance to vote, which makes the things easier.
This paper focusses on a system where the user can vote
remotely from anywhere using his/her computer or mobile
phone and doesnâ€™t require the voter to got to the polling
station through two step authentication of face recognition
and OTP system.
